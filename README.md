# WZModelExport
----------
Warzone2100 model search and view tool.  (version 0.1, stage:Nothing you can't achieve with notepad)
----------
A personal interest project.  My initial plan was to find and combine different droid parts to export as a 3D printable object.

WMIT.exe is also used for viewing models (see https://github.com/Warzone2100/WMIT).

The 'view as OBJ' option uses shell-execute to activate the default application for handling OBJ files.

There is no current support for creating an STL file, for now individual models can be saved as .obj after opening them in WMIT.exe.
