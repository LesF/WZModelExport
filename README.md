# WZModelExport
----------
Warzone2100 model search and view tool.  (version 0.1, stage:Nothing you can't achieve with notepad)
----------
A personal interest project.  My initial plan was to find and combine different droid parts to export as a 3D printable object.

WMIT.exe is used for viewing models (see https://github.com/Warzone2100/WMIT).  This can also be used to save a model as an .obj file.

The 'view as OBJ' option uses shell-execute to activate the default application for handling OBJ files.

There is no current support for creating an STL file.
